# flask-socialapp

Flask-socialapp is a social application with functionalities like friends adding and posts creating. This project got written because I wanted to learn some new skills about Flask and SQLAlchemy usage. Project is still under development - it needs a lot of improvements.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required assets.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Set the environment variable and run the Flask server in the cloned directory.

```bash
python -m $env:FLASK_APP:"main"
```

```bash
python -m flask run
```

Then type "localhost:5000/loginPage" in your browser.

```bash
localhost:5000/loginPage
```
